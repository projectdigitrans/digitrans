This repository contains working material for the research project "Digital Transformation: Employment Risks and Quality of Work". This project evolves around the innovative data module on capturing digital transformation in the German Socio-Economic Panel. The aim of the project is to use this data module to understand the spread of different aspects on digitalization and their impacts on the world of work.

The project is supported by the [The Policy Lab Digital, Work & Society](https://www.denkfabrik-bmas.de/en/) at the [German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs](https://www.bmas.de/EN/Home/home.html).
