# Data module on digital exposure and its impacts on employment and quality of work

Our research group developed a data module to measure technological exposure in household data based on the Socio-Economic Panel. In 2019, the module was pre-tested in the SOEP Innovation Sample (SOEP-IS). In 2020, the module became part of the main SOEP survey.
