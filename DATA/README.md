# Data module on digital exposure and its impacts on employment and quality of work

Our research group developed a data module to measure technological exposure in household data based on the Socio-Economic Panel. In 2019, the module was pre-tested in the SOEP Innovation Sample (SOEP-IS). In 2020, the module became part of the main SOEP survey (SOEP-Core).

## Data description

The data modules in the SOEP-IS and SOEP-Core aim at measuring technological exposure in three domains: 

**(1) AI:**  by measuring technology-aided involvement in text, image, language recognition as well as answering questions on specialized knowledge

**(2) platform work:** by asking question on platform-based selling, renting and gig searching activities, income they generate and time they require.

**(3) digitalized workplace:** by gathering information on tasks, tools and their usage on the workplace.

For all three domains, we aimed at designing questionnaire items so that they make sense for as many employed and self-employed as possible and are sustainable over time. For instance, we avoided buzz-words that are likely to change their meaning over time. 

A detailed description of our methodological approach is accepted for publication in the "Data Observer" section of the Journal of Economics and Statistics. An update with the link to the open-access paper is coming soon.


## Module on Digital Exposure

The module on digital exposure leans on the [existing variables landscape of the SOEP](../MISC/Appendix_A_Existing_Questionnaire_Landscape.pdf), that already comprises many aspects of the work life potentially affected by digital exposure. 

## Questionnaires

The full questionnaire of SOEP-IS 2019 can be found here: in [German](../MISC/diw_ssp0953.pdf) and in [English](../MISC/diw_ssp0956.pdf).

The full questionnaire of SOEP-Core 2020 can be found here: in [German](../MISC/diw_ssp1056.pdf) and in [English](../MISC/diw_ssp1069.pdf).

## Access

The SOEP data are available to the reseach community free of charge. More details on data access can be found [here](https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.601584.en/data_access.html).
