# Data module on digital exposure and its impacts on employment and quality of work

Our research group developed a data module to measure technological exposure in household data based on the Socio-Economic Panel. In 2019, the module was pre-tested in the SOEP Innovation Sample (SOEP-IS). In 2020, the module became part of the main SOEP survey.

## Data description



## Module on Digital Exposure

The module on digital exposure leans on the [existing variables landscape of the SOEP](../MISC/Appendix_A_Existing_Questionnaire_Landscape.pdf), that already comprises many aspects of the work life potentially affected by digital exposure. 

## Questionnaires

The full questionnaire of SOEP-IS 2019 can be found here: in [German](../MISC/diw_ssp0953.pdf) and in [English](../MISC/diw_ssp0956.pdf).

The full questionnaire of SOEP-core 2020 can be found here: in [German](../MISC/diw_ssp1056.pdf) and in [English](../MISC/diw_ssp1069.pdf).

## Access

The SOEP data are available to the reseach community free of charge. More details on data access can be found [here](https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.601584.en/data_access.html).
